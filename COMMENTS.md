Because of how I managed my app already it wouldn't generate API calls unless a new postcode was actually submitted
I have attempted to add local storage to my app but ran out of time to fully test it
As a result, I'm not sure if this is actually working as I intended it to or if it just doesn't generate API calls becasue of how I previously structure it.
